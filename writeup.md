Abstract:


Intro

Q3 What have you done so far?

So far we have created all the "drawing boards" and "outlines" for our visualizations and page layout. On our website, we have a novel visualization of a CNN which we will build upon further using interactive sub-visuals that are paired with information about that specific part of the process. 


Q4 What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why?

I think the most challenging part of our project to design will be showcasing the CNN process step by step and how the image is transformed. We want the visualization to be interactive and informative but we also don't want to overwhelm our readers as CNNs do have many layers and can have high dimensionality. Because of this, it can be difficult to make our visualization clear and effective.
